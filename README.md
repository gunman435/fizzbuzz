# FizzBuzz
The standard FizzBuzz tests written in multiple languages with mutliple adaptations. There are many different versions within one language because I wanted to take the idea of FizzBuzz and apply it to different ways of displaying/modifying the data. For example, LUA > Love2D. I want to make some sort of graphical interpretation of the FizzBuzz test.
